In this lab, we are focusing on core machine learning concepts and implementing them through hands-on exercises. The topics covered are:

1. Introduction to Machine Learning
Understanding the basics of Machine Learning, its types (supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning), and real-world applications.
Learning the typical ML workflow, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
2. Data Preprocessing
Techniques to handle missing data, such as imputation (mean/median/mode) and data removal.
Normalization and Standardization: Applying min-max scaling and Z-score normalization.
Feature Engineering: Selection and extraction of important features, encoding categorical data, and creating new features.
Handling Imbalanced Data: Using oversampling (like SMOTE) and undersampling methods.
3. Supervised Learning Algorithms
Linear Regression: Implementing regression models to predict continuous values and evaluating them using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
Logistic Regression: Using logistic regression for binary classification, understanding the sigmoid function, and evaluating models with precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Decision Trees and Random Forests: Learning tree-based models, understanding how splits are made, and using Random Forest for ensemble learning to improve accuracy. Preventing overfitting with techniques like pruning.
4. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
K-Means Clustering: Implementing clustering algorithms, determining optimal clusters using the elbow method, and visualizing the results.
Hierarchical Clustering: Applying agglomerative and divisive clustering, using dendrograms for visualization.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reducing the dimensionality of datasets while retaining essential variance.
5. Model Evaluation and Tuning
Train/Test Split and Cross-Validation: Dividing data into training and testing sets, using K-fold cross-validation to generalize models.
Overfitting and Underfitting: Identifying these issues with learning curves and adjusting models accordingly.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Using Grid Search or Random Search to find the optimal parameters for machine learning models.
6. Real-World Project
Building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline on a real-world dataset (e.g., from Kaggle), including data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and tuning.
Deploying a trained model using Flask or FastAPI (optional).
Tools and Libraries:
Python Libraries:
NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation.
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization.
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.
TensorFlow, Keras for deep learning (optional).
This lab provides a comprehensive foundation in machine learning, preparing students to handle real-world data and build predictive models effectively.
